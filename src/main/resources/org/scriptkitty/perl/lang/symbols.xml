=item @LAST_MATCH_END

=item @+
X<@+> X<@LAST_MATCH_END>

This array holds the offsets of the ends of the last successful
submatches in the currently active dynamic scope.  C<$+[0]> is
the offset into the string of the end of the entire match.  This
is the same value as what the C<pos> function returns when called
on the variable that was matched against.  The I<n>th element
of this array holds the offset of the I<n>th submatch, so
C<$+[1]> is the offset past where C<$1> ends, C<$+[2]> the offset
past where C<$2> ends, and so on.  You can use C<$#+> to determine
how many subgroups were in the last successful match.  See the
examples given for the C<@-> variable.

C<$-[0]> is the offset of the start of the last successful match.
C<$-[>I<n>C<]> is the offset of the start of the substring matched by
I<n>-th subpattern, or undef if the subpattern did not match.

Thus, after a match against C<$_>, C<$&> coincides with C<substr $_, $-[0],
$+[0] - $-[0]>.  Similarly, $I<n> coincides with C<substr $_, $-[n],
$+[n] - $-[n]> if C<$-[n]> is defined, and $+ coincides with
C<substr $_, $-[$#-], $+[$#-] - $-[$#-]>.  One can use C<$#-> to find the
last matched subgroup in the last successful match.  Contrast with
C<$#+>, the number of subgroups in the regular expression.  Compare
with C<@+>.

This array holds the offsets of the beginnings of the last
successful submatches in the currently active dynamic scope.
C<$-[0]> is the offset into the string of the beginning of the
entire match.  The I<n>th element of this array holds the offset
of the I<n>th submatch, so C<$-[1]> is the offset where C<$1>
begins, C<$-[2]> the offset where C<$2> begins, and so on.

The array C<@INC> contains the list of places that the C<do EXPR>,
C<require>, or C<use> constructs look for their library files.  It
initially consists of the arguments to any B<-I> command-line
switches, followed by the default Perl library, probably
F</usr/local/lib/perl>, followed by ".", to represent the current
directory.  ("." will not be appended if taint checks are enabled,
either by C<-T> or by C<-t>.)  If you need to modify this at runtime,
you should use the C<use lib> pragma to get the machine-dependent
library properly loaded also:

    use lib '/mypath/libdir/';
    use SomeMod;

You can also insert hooks into the file inclusion system by putting Perl
code directly into C<@INC>.  Those hooks may be subroutine references,
array references or blessed objects.  See L<perlfunc/require> for details.

=item %LAST_PAREN_MATCH

=item %+
X<%+> X<%LAST_PAREN_MATCH>

Similar to C<@+>, the C<%+> hash allows access to the named capture
buffers, should they exist, in the last successful match in the
currently active dynamic scope.

For example, C<$+{foo}> is equivalent to C<$1> after the following match:

    'foo' =~ /(?<foo>foo)/;

The keys of the C<%+> hash list only the names of buffers that have
captured (and that are thus associated to defined values).

The underlying behaviour of C<%+> is provided by the
L<Tie::Hash::NamedCapture> module.

B<Note:> C<%-> and C<%+> are tied views into a common internal hash
associated with the last successful regular expression.  Therefore mixing
iterative access to them via C<each> may have unpredictable results.
Likewise, if the last successful match changes, then the results may be
surprising.

This variable was added in Perl 5.10.

This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.

X<%-> X<%LAST_MATCH_START>

Similar to C<%+>, this variable allows access to the named capture groups
in the last successful match in the currently active dynamic scope.  To
each capture group name found in the regular expression, it associates a
reference to an array containing the list of values captured by all
buffers with that name (should there be several of them), in the order
where they appear.

Here's an example:

    if ('1234' =~ /(?<A>1)(?<B>2)(?<A>3)(?<B>4)/) {
        foreach my $bufname (sort keys %-) {
            my $ary = $-{$bufname};

                print "\$-{$bufname}[$idx] : ",
                      (defined($ary->[$idx])
                          ? "'$ary->[$idx]'"
                          : "undef"),
                      "\n";
            }
        }
    }

would print out:

    $-{A}[0] : '1'
    $-{A}[1] : '3'
    $-{B}[0] : '2'
    $-{B}[1] : '4'

The keys of the C<%-> hash correspond to all buffer names found in
the regular expression.

The C<%^H> hash provides the same scoping semantic as C<$^H>.  This makes
it useful for implementation of lexically scoped pragmas.  See

When putting items into C<%^H>, in order to avoid conflicting with other
users of the hash there is a convention regarding which keys to use.
A module should use only keys that begin with the module's name (the
name of its main package) and a "/" character.  For example, a module
C<Foo::Bar> should use keys such as C<Foo::Bar/baz>.

operator uses this hash to determine whether a particular file has
already been included.

If the file was loaded via a hook (e.g. a subroutine reference, see
L<perlfunc/require> for a description of these hooks), this hook is
by default inserted into C<%INC> in place of a filename.  Note, however,
that the hook may have set the C<%INC> entry by itself to provide some more

The hash C<%SIG> contains signal handlers for signals.  For example:

    sub handler {   # 1st argument is signal name
	my($sig) = @_;
	print "Caught a SIG$sig--shutting down\n";
	close(LOG);
	exit(0);
	}

    $SIG{'INT'}  = \&handler;
    $SIG{'QUIT'} = \&handler;
    ...
    $SIG{'INT'}  = 'DEFAULT';   # restore default action
    $SIG{'QUIT'} = 'IGNORE';    # ignore SIGQUIT

Using a value of C<'IGNORE'> usually has the effect of ignoring the
signal, except for the C<CHLD> signal.  See L<perlipc> for more about
this special case.

Here are some other examples:

    $SIG{"PIPE"} = "Plumber";   # assumes main::Plumber (not
				# recommended)
    $SIG{"PIPE"} = \&Plumber;   # just fine; assume current
				# Plumber
    $SIG{"PIPE"} = *Plumber;    # somewhat esoteric
    $SIG{"PIPE"} = Plumber();   # oops, what did Plumber()
				# return??

Be sure not to use a bareword as the name of a signal handler,
lest you inadvertently call it.

If your system has the C<sigaction()> function then signal handlers
are installed using it.  This means you get reliable signal handling.

The default delivery policy of signals changed in Perl 5.8.0 from
immediate (also known as "unsafe") to deferred, also known as "safe
signals".  See L<perlipc> for more information.

Certain internal hooks can be also set using the C<%SIG> hash.  The
routine indicated by C<$SIG{__WARN__}> is called when a warning
message is about to be printed.  The warning message is passed as the
first argument.  The presence of a C<__WARN__> hook causes the
ordinary printing of warnings to C<STDERR> to be suppressed.  You can
use this to save warnings in a variable, or turn warnings into fatal
errors, like this:

    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { die $_[0] };
    eval $proggie;

As the C<'IGNORE'> hook is not supported by C<__WARN__>, you can
disable warnings using the empty subroutine:

    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub {};

The routine indicated by C<$SIG{__DIE__}> is called when a fatal
exception is about to be thrown.  The error message is passed as the
first argument.  When a C<__DIE__> hook routine returns, the exception
processing continues as it would have in the absence of the hook,
unless the hook routine itself exits via a C<goto &sub>, a loop exit,
or a C<die()>.  The C<__DIE__> handler is explicitly disabled during
the call, so that you can die from a C<__DIE__> handler.  Similarly
for C<__WARN__>.

Due to an implementation glitch, the C<$SIG{__DIE__}> hook is called
even inside an C<eval()>.  Do not use this to rewrite a pending
exception in C<$@>, or as a bizarre substitute for overriding
C<CORE::GLOBAL::die()>.  This strange action at a distance may be fixed
in a future release so that C<$SIG{__DIE__}> is only called if your
program is about to exit, as was the original intent.  Any other use is
deprecated.

C<__DIE__>/C<__WARN__> handlers are very special in one respect: they
may be called to report (probable) errors found by the parser.  In such
a case the parser may be in inconsistent state, so any attempt to
evaluate Perl code from such a handler will probably result in a
segfault.  This means that warnings or errors that result from parsing
Perl should be used with extreme caution, like this:

    require Carp if defined $^S;
    Carp::confess("Something wrong") if defined &Carp::confess;
    die "Something wrong, but could not load Carp to give "
      . "backtrace...\n\t"
      . "To see backtrace try starting Perl with -MCarp switch";

Here the first line will load C<Carp> I<unless> it is the parser who
called the handler.  The second line will print backtrace and die if
C<Carp> was available.  The third line will be executed only if C<Carp> was
not available.

Having to even think about the C<$^S> variable in your exception
handlers is simply wrong.  C<$SIG{__DIE__}> as currently implemented
invites grievous and difficult to track down errors.  Avoid it
and use an C<END{}> or CORE::GLOBAL::die override instead.

See L<perlfunc/die>, L<perlfunc/warn>, L<perlfunc/eval>, and
L<warnings> for additional information.

Because of this specialness C<$a> and C<$b> don't need to be declared
(using C<use vars>, or C<our()>) even when using the C<strict 'vars'>
pragma.  Don't lexicalize them with C<my $a> or C<my $b> if you want to
be able to use them in the C<sort()> comparison block or function.

The default input and pattern-searching space.  The following pairs are
equivalent:

    while (<>) {...}    # equivalent only in while!
    while (defined($_ = <>)) {...}

    /^Subject:/
    $_ =~ /^Subject:/

    tr/a-z/A-Z/
    $_ =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/

    chomp
    chomp($_)

Here are the places where Perl will assume C<$_> even if you don't use it:

=over 3

=item *

The following functions use C<$_> as a default argument:

abs, alarm, chomp, chop, chr, chroot,
cos, defined, eval, evalbytes, exp, glob,
hex, int, lc, lcfirst, length, log, lstat, mkdir, oct, ord, pos, print,
quotemeta, readlink, readpipe, ref, require, reverse (in scalar context only),
rmdir, sin, split (on its second argument), sqrt, stat, study, uc, ucfirst,
unlink, unpack.

=item *

All file tests (C<-f>, C<-d>) except for C<-t>, which defaults to STDIN.
See L<perlfunc/-X>

=item *

The pattern matching operations C<m//>, C<s///> and C<tr///> (aka C<y///>)
when used without an C<=~> operator.

=item *

The default iterator variable in a C<foreach> loop if no other
variable is supplied.

=item *

The implicit iterator variable in the C<grep()> and C<map()> functions.

=item *

The implicit variable of C<given()>.

=item *

The default place to put an input record when a C<< <FH> >>
operation's result is tested by itself as the sole criterion of a C<while>
test.  Outside a C<while> test, this will not happen.

=back

As C<$_> is a global variable, this may lead in some cases to unwanted
side-effects.  As of perl 5.10, you can now use a lexical version of
C<$_> by declaring it in a file or in a block with C<my>.  Moreover,
declaring C<our $_> restores the global C<$_> in the current scope.

Mnemonic: underline is understood in certain operations.

=item HANDLE->input_line_number( EXPR )

=item $INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

=item $NR

=item $.
X<$.> X<$NR> X<$INPUT_LINE_NUMBER> X<line number>

Current line number for the last filehandle accessed.

Each filehandle in Perl counts the number of lines that have been read
from it.  (Depending on the value of C<$/>, Perl's idea of what
constitutes a line may not match yours.)  When a line is read from a
filehandle (via C<readline()> or C<< <> >>), or when C<tell()> or
C<seek()> is called on it, C<$.> becomes an alias to the line counter
for that filehandle.

You can adjust the counter by assigning to C<$.>, but this will not
actually move the seek pointer.  I<< Localizing C<$.> will not localize
the filehandle's line count >>.  Instead, it will localize perl's notion
of which filehandle C<$.> is currently aliased to.

C<$.> is reset when the filehandle is closed, but B<not> when an open
filehandle is reopened without an intervening C<close()>.  For more
details, see L<< perlop/"IE<sol>O Operators" >>.  Because C<< <> >> never does
an explicit close, line numbers increase across C<ARGV> files (but see
examples in L<perlfunc/eof>).

You can also use C<< HANDLE->input_line_number(EXPR) >> to access the
line counter for a given filehandle without having to worry about
which handle you last accessed.

Mnemonic: many programs use "." to mean the current line number.

=item HANDLE->input_record_separator( EXPR )

=item $INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR

=item $RS

=item $/
X<$/> X<$RS> X<$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR>

The input record separator, newline by default.  This influences Perl's
idea of what a "line" is.  Works like B<awk>'s RS variable, including
treating empty lines as a terminator if set to the null string (an
empty line cannot contain any spaces or tabs).  You may set it to a
multi-character string to match a multi-character terminator, or to
C<undef> to read through the end of file.  Setting it to C<"\n\n">
means something slightly different than setting to C<"">, if the file
contains consecutive empty lines.  Setting to C<""> will treat two or
more consecutive empty lines as a single empty line.  Setting to
C<"\n\n"> will blindly assume that the next input character belongs to
the next paragraph, even if it's a newline.

    local $/;           # enable "slurp" mode
    local $_ = <FH>;    # whole file now here
    s/\n[ \t]+/ /g;

Remember: the value of C<$/> is a string, not a regex.  B<awk> has to
be better for something. :-)

Setting C<$/> to a reference to an integer, scalar containing an
integer, or scalar that's convertible to an integer will attempt to
read records instead of lines, with the maximum record size being the
referenced integer.  So this:

    local $/ = \32768; # or \"32768", or \$var_containing_32768
    open my $fh, "<", $myfile or die $!;
    local $_ = <$fh>;

will read a record of no more than 32768 bytes from FILE.  If you're
not reading from a record-oriented file (or your OS doesn't have
record-oriented files), then you'll likely get a full chunk of data
with every read.  If a record is larger than the record size you've
set, you'll get the record back in pieces.  Trying to set the record
size to zero or less will cause reading in the (rest of the) whole file.

On VMS only, record reads bypass PerlIO layers and any associated
buffering,so you must not mix record and non-record reads on the
same filehandle.  Record mode mixes with line mode only when the
same buffering layer is in use for both modes.

If you perform a record read on a FILE with an encoding layer such as
C<:encoding(latin1)> or C<:utf8>, you may get an invalid string as a
result, may leave the FILE positioned between characters in the stream
and may not be reading the number of bytes from the underlying file
that you specified.  This behaviour may change without warning in a
future version of perl.

not; C<$|> tells you only whether you've asked Perl explicitly to
flush after each write).  STDOUT will typically be line buffered if
output is to the terminal and block buffered otherwise.  Setting this

=item $CHILD_ERROR

=item $?
X<$?> X<$CHILD_ERROR>

The status returned by the last pipe close, backtick (C<``>) command,
successful call to C<wait()> or C<waitpid()>, or from the C<system()>
operator.  This is just the 16-bit status word returned by the
traditional Unix C<wait()> system call (or else is made up to look
like it).  Thus, the exit value of the subprocess is really (C<< $?>>
8 >>), and C<$? & 127> gives which signal, if any, the process died
from, and C<$? & 128> reports whether there was a core dump.

Additionally, if the C<h_errno> variable is supported in C, its value
is returned via C<$?> if any C<gethost*()> function fails.

If you have installed a signal handler for C<SIGCHLD>, the
value of C<$?> will usually be wrong outside that handler.

Inside an C<END> subroutine C<$?> contains the value that is going to be
given to C<exit()>.  You can modify C<$?> in an C<END> subroutine to
change the exit status of your program.  For example:

    END {
	$? = 1 if $? == 255;  # die would make it 255
    }

Under VMS, the pragma C<use vmsish 'status'> makes C<$?> reflect the
actual VMS exit status, instead of the default emulation of POSIX
status; see L<perlvms/$?> for details.

Mnemonic: similar to B<sh> and B<ksh>.

It can be used immediately before invoking the C<die()> operator,

The process number of the Perl running this script.  Though you I<can> set
this variable, doing so is generally discouraged, although it can be

across C<fork()> calls.

Note for Linux and Debian GNU/kFreeBSD users: Before Perl v5.16.0 perl
would emulate POSIX semantics on Linux systems using LinuxThreads, a
partial implementation of POSIX Threads that has since been superseded
by the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL).

LinuxThreads is now obsolete on Linux, and and caching C<getpid()>
like this made embedding perl unnecessarily complex (since you'd have
to manually update the value of $$), so now C<$$> and C<getppid()>
will always return the same values as the underlying C library.

Debian GNU/kFreeBSD systems also used LinuxThreads up until and
including the 6.0 release, but after that moved to FreeBSD thread
semantics, which are POSIX-like.

To see if your system is affected by this discrepancy check if
C<getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION | grep -q NPTL> returns a false
value. NTPL threads preserve the POSIX semantics.

invaluable for some testing purposes.  It will be reset automatically
across C<fork()> calls.

Note for Linux and Debian GNU/kFreeBSD users: Before Perl v5.16.0 perl
would emulate POSIX semantics on Linux systems using LinuxThreads, a
partial implementation of POSIX Threads that has since been superseded
by the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL).

LinuxThreads is now obsolete on Linux, and and caching C<getpid()>
like this made embedding perl unnecessarily complex (since you'd have
to manually update the value of $$), so now C<$$> and C<getppid()>
will always return the same values as the underlying C library.

Debian GNU/kFreeBSD systems also used LinuxThreads up until and
including the 6.0 release, but after that moved to FreeBSD thread
semantics, which are POSIX-like.

To see if your system is affected by this discrepancy check if
C<getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION | grep -q NPTL> returns a false
value. NTPL threads preserve the POSIX semantics.

Mnemonic: same as shells.

=item $PROGRAM_NAME

=item $0
X<$0> X<$PROGRAM_NAME>

Contains the name of the program being executed.

On some (but not all) operating systems assigning to C<$0> modifies
the argument area that the C<ps> program sees.  On some platforms you
may have to use special C<ps> options or a different C<ps> to see the
changes.  Modifying the C<$0> is more useful as a way of indicating the
current program state than it is for hiding the program you're
running.

Note that there are platform-specific limitations on the maximum
length of C<$0>.  In the most extreme case it may be limited to the
space occupied by the original C<$0>.

In some platforms there may be arbitrary amount of padding, for
example space characters, after the modified name as shown by C<ps>.
In some platforms this padding may extend all the way to the original
length of the argument area, no matter what you do (this is the case
for example with Linux 2.2).

Note for BSD users: setting C<$0> does not completely remove "perl"
from the ps(1) output.  For example, setting C<$0> to C<"foobar"> may
result in C<"perl: foobar (perl)"> (whether both the C<"perl: "> prefix
and the " (perl)" suffix are shown depends on your exact BSD variant
and version).  This is an operating system feature, Perl cannot help it.

In multithreaded scripts Perl coordinates the threads so that any
thread may modify its copy of the C<$0> and the change becomes visible
to ps(1) (assuming the operating system plays along).  Note that
the view of C<$0> the other threads have will not change since they
have their own copies of it.

If the program has been given to perl via the switches C<-e> or C<-E>,
C<$0> will contain the string C<"-e">.

On Linux as of perl 5.14 the legacy process name will be set with
C<prctl(2)>, in addition to altering the POSIX name via C<argv[0]> as
perl has done since version 4.000.  Now system utilities that read the
legacy process name such as ps, top and killall will recognize the
name you set when assigning to C<$0>.  The string you supply will be
cut off at 16 bytes, this is a limitation imposed by Linux.

=item $ARRAY_BASE

=item $[
X<$[> X<$ARRAY_BASE>

This variable stores the index of the first element in an array, and
of the first character in a substring.  The default is 0, but you could
theoretically set it to 1 to make Perl behave more like B<awk> (or Fortran)
when subscripting and when evaluating the index() and substr() functions.

As of release 5 of Perl, assignment to C<$[> is treated as a compiler
directive, and cannot influence the behavior of any other file.
(That's why you can only assign compile-time constants to it.)
Its use is highly discouraged.

Prior to Perl 5.10, assignment to C<$[> could be seen from outer lexical
scopes in the same file, unlike other compile-time directives (such as
L<strict>).  Using local() on it would bind its value strictly to a lexical
block.  Now it is always lexically scoped.

As of Perl 5.16, it is implemented by the L<arybase> module.  See
L<arybase> for more details on its behaviour.

Under C<use v5.16>, or C<no feature "array_base">, C<$[> no longer has any
effect, and always contains 0.  Assigning 0 to it is permitted, but any
other value will produce an error.

Mnemonic: [ begins subscripts.

    warn "No checksumming!\n" if $] < 3.019;

The floating point representation can sometimes lead to inaccurate
numeric comparisons.

=item $^H
X<$^H>

WARNING: This variable is strictly for
internal use only.  Its availability,
behavior, and contents are subject to change without notice.

This variable contains compile-time hints for the Perl interpreter.  At the
end of compilation of a BLOCK the value of this variable is restored to the
value when the interpreter started to compile the BLOCK.

When perl begins to parse any block construct that provides a lexical scope
(e.g., eval body, required file, subroutine body, loop body, or conditional
block), the existing value of C<$^H> is saved, but its value is left unchanged.
When the compilation of the block is completed, it regains the saved value.
Between the points where its value is saved and restored, code that
executes within BEGIN blocks is free to change the value of C<$^H>.

This behavior provides the semantic of lexical scoping, and is used in,
for instance, the C<use strict> pragma.

The contents should be an integer; different bits of it are used for
different pragmatic flags.  Here's an example:

    sub add_100 { $^H |= 0x100 }

    sub foo {
	BEGIN { add_100() }
	bar->baz($boon);
    }

Consider what happens during execution of the BEGIN block.  At this point
the BEGIN block has already been compiled, but the body of C<foo()> is still
being compiled.  The new value of C<$^H>
will therefore be visible only while
the body of C<foo()> is being compiled.

Substitution of C<BEGIN { add_100() }> block with:

    BEGIN { require strict; strict->import('vars') }

demonstrates how C<use strict 'vars'> is implemented.  Here's a conditional
version of the same lexical pragma:

    BEGIN {
	require strict; strict->import('vars') if $condition
    }

This variable was added in Perl 5.003.

=item $^M
X<$^M>

By default, running out of memory is an untrappable, fatal error.
However, if suitably built, Perl can use the contents of C<$^M>
as an emergency memory pool after C<die()>ing.  Suppose that your Perl
were compiled with C<-DPERL_EMERGENCY_SBRK> and used Perl's malloc.
Then

    $^M = 'a' x (1 << 16);

would allocate a 64K buffer for use in an emergency.  See the
F<INSTALL> file in the Perl distribution for information on how to
add custom C compilation flags when compiling perl.  To discourage casual
use of this advanced feature, there is no L<English|English> long name for
this variable.

The text matched by the used group most-recently closed (i.e. the group

This is primarily used inside C<(?{...})> blocks for examining text
recently matched.  For example, to effectively capture text to a variable
(in addition to C<$1>, C<$2>, etc.), replace C<(...)> with

    (?:(...)(?{ $var = $^N }))

By setting and then using C<$var> in this way relieves you from having to

represented as a C<version> object.

This variable first appeared in perl 5.6.0; earlier versions of perl
will see an undefined value.  Before perl 5.10.0 C<$^V> was represented
as a v-string.

C<$^V> can be used to determine whether the Perl interpreter executing
a script is in the right range of versions.  For example:

    warn "Hashes not randomized!\n" if !$^V or $^V lt v5.8.1

To convert C<$^V> into its string representation use C<sprintf()>'s
C<"%vd"> conversion:

    printf "version is v%vd\n", $^V;  # Perl's version

See the documentation of C<use VERSION> and C<require VERSION>
for a convenient way to fail if the running Perl interpreter is too old.

See also C<$]> for an older representation of the Perl version.

This variable was added in Perl 5.6.

=item $EXECUTABLE_NAME

=item $^X
X<$^X> X<$EXECUTABLE_NAME>

The name used to execute the current copy of Perl, from C's
C<argv[0]> or (where supported) F</proc/self/exe>.

Depending on the host operating system, the value of C<$^X> may be
a relative or absolute pathname of the perl program file, or may
be the string used to invoke perl but not the pathname of the
perl program file.  Also, most operating systems permit invoking
programs that are not in the PATH environment variable, so there
is no guarantee that the value of C<$^X> is in PATH.  For VMS, the
value may or may not include a version number.

You usually can use the value of C<$^X> to re-invoke an independent
copy of the same perl that is currently running, e.g.,

    @first_run = `$^X -le "print int rand 100 for 1..100"`;

But recall that not all operating systems support forking or
capturing of the output of commands, so this complex statement
may not be portable.

It is not safe to use the value of C<$^X> as a path name of a file,
as some operating systems that have a mandatory suffix on
executable files do not require use of the suffix when invoking
a command.  To convert the value of C<$^X> to a path name, use the
following statements:

    # Build up a set of file names (not command names).
    use Config;
    my $this_perl = $^X;
    if ($^O ne 'VMS') {
	$this_perl .= $Config{_exe}
	  unless $this_perl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;
	}

Because many operating systems permit anyone with read access to
the Perl program file to make a copy of it, patch the copy, and
then execute the copy, the security-conscious Perl programmer
should take care to invoke the installed copy of perl, not the
copy referenced by C<$^X>.  The following statements accomplish
this goal, and produce a pathname that can be invoked as a
command or referenced as a file.

    use Config;
    my $secure_perl_path = $Config{perlpath};
    if ($^O ne 'VMS') {
	$secure_perl_path .= $Config{_exe}
