*ARGV=
ARGV=       ARGV    The special filehandle that iterates over command-line\n               filenames in @ARGV. Usually written as the null filehandle in\n               the angle operator "<>". Note that currently "ARGV" only has\n               its magical effect within the "<>" operator; elsewhere it is\n               just a plain filehandle corresponding to the last file opened\n               by "<>". In particular, passing "\\*ARGV" as a parameter to a\n               function that expects a filehandle may not cause your function\n               to automatically read the contents of all the files in @ARGV.
ARGVOUT=       ARGVOUT The special filehandle that points to the currently open output\n               file when doing edit-in-place processing with --ii.  Useful when\n               you have to do a lot of inserting and don't want to keep\n               modifying $_.  See perlrun for the --ii switch.
